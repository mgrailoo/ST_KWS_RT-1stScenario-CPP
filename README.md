Low-Power Keyword Spotting deployment using Voice Detection on Sensor-Tile Platform

Abstractâ€”Keyword spotting (KWS) is a critical component in low power smart devices with speech-based user interactions. It is typically used as a front-end to wake up the full-scale speech recognition. Since KWS still needs to be always on, i.e. continuously listening, it has strong implications on power consumption. In this paper, voice activity detection task is activated using the build-in DFSDM analog watchdog to minimize power consumption of KWS on SensorTile. The idea is putting
some parts of KWS in sleep mode when there is nothing of interest to hear, or it is just noisy voice. The part awakes the KWS as soon as voice is detected, while itself is always-on. It leads to a reduction in the KWS power consumption. The impact of the voice detection activation on power consumption is investigated through three scenarios of normal, and low power deployment with DMA streaming from beginning, or after the detection.
